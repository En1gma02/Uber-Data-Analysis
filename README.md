# Uber Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data using Python. The dataset is processed and transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis and visualization.

## Data Pipeline
The data pipeline involves several steps:
1. Data loading from an external API.
2. Transformation of raw data into structured formats.
3. Exporting the transformed data to a BigQuery warehouse.

## Project Structure
- **Uber Data Pipeline.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data processing and transformation.
- **extract.py**: Python script for loading data from an API.
- **load.py**: Python script for exporting data to BigQuery.
- **transform.py**: Python script for transforming raw data into structured formats.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Uber Data Pipeline.ipynb`.
3. Ensure required Python packages are installed.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Requests
- BigQuery
